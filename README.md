# VideoMinify

My internet connection is very bad. But I still wanted to upload videos for my friends.

Handling FFMPEG by hand every time is tedious and I tried to automate this step for myself. 

Meet VideoMinify!

Just drag & drop your video files onto the executable and this tool will create a minified copy of that video right next to your original one.

It also works with multiple videos at a time. 

Check the release tab for built a Windows x64 version.
